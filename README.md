Project Title
Traffic Signal System 
________________________________________
Introduction
Traffic congestion and improper signal management are common problems in urban areas. Understanding how traffic signals work and how vehicles and pedestrians interact at an intersection is important for better traffic planning.
In this project, a smart traffic signal system is simulated using OpenGL and C++. The project visually represents a real-life road intersection where vehicles and pedestrians follow traffic rules based on signal states.

Objectives of the Project
The main objectives of this project are:
•	To simulate a real-life traffic signal system using computer graphics
•	To understand the basic concepts of OpenGL such as drawing shapes, transformations, and animation
•	To show how traffic signals control vehicle and pedestrian movement
•	To develop a simple scenario-based simulation instead of a game

Project Description
The project represents a four-way road intersection. Vehicles move from different directions and stop at traffic signals when the light is red. When the signal turns green, vehicles continue moving.
A zebra crossing is included for pedestrians, who are allowed to cross the road when the pedestrian signal is active. The project also includes a day and night mode, where street lights turn on automatically at night.
All objects such as roads, cars, signals, buildings, and trees are drawn using basic OpenGL primitives like rectangles and circles.

Tools and Technologies Used
•	Programming Language: C++
•	Graphics Library: OpenGL
•	Utility Library: GLUT / FreeGLUT
•	Development Environment: Code::Blocks

Implementation Approach
The project is implemented by dividing the work into small modules.
Separate functions are used to draw roads, vehicles, traffic lights, and other objects.
Traffic signal logic is controlled using timers and conditional statements.
Vehicle movement is handled using position updates and animation loops.
This modular approach makes the code easy to understand and modify.

Expected Outcome
After completing the project, the system will visually demonstrate how a traffic signal controls vehicles and pedestrians at an intersection. The project will help in understanding both computer graphics concepts and basic traffic management logic.

Conclusion
This project provides a simple but effective simulation of a real-world traffic signal system. It combines programming logic with graphical visualization using OpenGL. The project is suitable for understanding scenario-based simulations and demonstrates practical use of computer graphics in solving real-life problems.
